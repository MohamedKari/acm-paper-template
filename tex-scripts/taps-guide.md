- ensure html passes
- do not \input empty files
- no def of affiliation
- no linebreak before \textcircled
- don't use \endinput
- Everything after \endinput is ignored, not only within the file 
- \autoref{<non-existent_label>} fails: Careful when adding sections one by one with forward references

# Uncertain
- \setitemsize can fail
